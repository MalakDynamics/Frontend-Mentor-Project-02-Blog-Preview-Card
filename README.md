# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

Tried more to get the pixel alignment right with this one. Went a little off the course getting it aligned for 320px screens.

This is a solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

## My process

This time I used Figma, and it's still immensely easier to refernece that than to eyeball everything. I suspect I am closer to a pixel-perfect replica due to using the resource.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Still need to brush up on responsive design. I don't like when small adjustments necessitate a snap to re-fit, and I think that I can get a lot smoother of an adjustment with more care and attention. Still consider this a step up from previous project. 

Learned a deeper appreciation for how I resize images on a page. Initially approached this the wrong way and I was trying to scale the image down, but really I needed to crop it out.

Additionally, on revision 2 I would create root variables for the font styles.

### Continued development

For future projects I would like to make the responsive design feel more second-nature or seamless to the end user.
